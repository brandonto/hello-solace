JCSMP API Dependencies

To build/run JCSMP API based applications, all jar files list in lib directory 
are needed.

The jar files in lib/optional directory are packaged for convenience purposes, 
they include files use for logging and debugging.

NOTICE: Including log4j-1.2.9.jar without a log4j.properties file on the classpath
may impact program performance by turning the log level to DEBUG.
